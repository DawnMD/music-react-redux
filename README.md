# Music selection with redux

Practice project on how to connect and use redux with react.

## Working

The initial state of redux contains an array of songs with title and duration and a selectedSong with a value of null. When a particular song is clicked in the rendered list,a redux action is dispatched with the particular songs object which then assigned to the selectedSong key and then rendered into the DOM.
